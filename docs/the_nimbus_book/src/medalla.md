# Become a Medalla validator

This chapter will take you through how to become a validator on the eth2 testnet [Medalla](https://github.com/goerli/medalla).

If you generated your signing key using the [eth2 launchpad](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/), and wish to import it into the Nimbus client, this page is for you.

> If you haven't created your validator key yet, we recommend you do so using the [launchpad](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/). If you're not sure what the eth2 launchpad is, we recommend reading this [introductory post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/07/27/eth2-validator-launchpad/) first.


## Prerequisites

If this is your first time playing with Nimbus, make sure you [install our external dependencies](./install.md) first.

This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of the [command line](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics#:~:text=Learn%20Enough%20Command%20Line%20to%20Be%20Dangerous%20is%20an%20introduction,broad%20an%20audience%20as%20possible.).

## Validating

To start validating on the `medalla` network:


#### 1. Clone the nim beacon chain repository

```
git clone https://github.com/status-im/nim-beacon-chain
cd nim-beacon-chain
git checkout devel
```

#### 2. Build the beacon node
```
make beacon_node
```

*Patience... this may take a few minutes.*

#### 3. Import keystore(s)

```
build/beacon_node deposits import  --data-dir=build/data/shared_medalla_0 <YOUR VALIDATOR KEYS DIRECTORY>
```

Replacing `<YOUR VALIDATOR KEYS DIRECTORY>` with the full pathname of your `validator_keys` directory.

> Tip: run `pwd` in your `validator_keys` directory to print the full pathname to the console.

You'll be asked to enter the password you created to encrypt your keystore(s) in the *Generate Keys* section of the Launchpad process. Don't worry, this is entirely normal. Your validator client needs both your keystore(s) and the password encrypting it to import your [keys](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/05/21/keys/) (since it needs to decrypt the keystore in order to be able to use it to sign on your behalf).


#### 4. Connect to Medalla

```
make medalla
```

This will build Nimbus and its dependencies, and connect you to Medalla.
You should see that the beacon node has launched with your validator attached:

#### 5. Keep an eye on your validator

If you deposited after the [genesis](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/genesis) state was decided (August 2nd 1300 UTC), your validators will have been put in a queue based on deposit time, and will slowly be inducted into the validator set after genesis. Getting through the queue may take a few hours or days.

The best way to keep track of your validator's status is [medalla.beaconcha.in](https://medalla.beaconcha.in) (click on the orange magnifying glass at the very top and paste in its public key). 

You can even [create an account](https://medalla.beaconcha.in/register) to add alerts and keep track of your validator's [performance](https://medalla.beaconcha.in/dashboard).

#### 6. Keep your validator updated

Finally, makes sure you stay on the lookout for any critical updates to Nimbus. This best way to do so is through the **medalla-announcements** channel on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/XRxWahP).

To update to the latest version, disconnect from medalla and run:

```
git pull && make update
```

Once the update is complete, run `make medalla` to reconnect to the network.

Looking forward to seeing you on Medalla! ðŸ’›

### A note on keys

The Nimbus client will only ever import your signing key -- in any case, if you used the deposit launchpad, this is the only key you should have (you can generate the withdrawal key from your mnemonic when you wish to withdraw).

The keys your Nimbus client has access to are stored in the `build/data/shared_medalla_0/` folder, under `secrets` and `validators`.

The `secrets` folder contains the common secret that gives you access to all your validator keys. And the `validators` folder contains your keystores.

For more on keys in eth2, see [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/05/21/keys/).

## Advanced options

### Start multiple nodes

You can start multiple local nodes, in different terminal windows/tabs, by specifying numeric IDs:

```
make medalla NODE_ID=0 # the default
make medalla NODE_ID=1
make medalla NODE_ID=2
```

### Attach multiple validators to the same beacon node

Simply [import as many keystores as you wish](./medalla.md#3-import-keystores) before running `make medalla`. Nimbus will automagically find your keys and attach your validators. See [key management](./medalla.md#key-management) for more information on where we store your keys.

To give you some context, we (the Nimbus team) are currently running 170 validators per beacon node on our AWS instances.

### Change the TCP and UDP ports

To change the TCP and UDP ports from their default value of 9000 to 9100, say, run:

```
make BASE_PORT=9100 medalla
```

You may need to do this if you are running another client.


### Make a deposit directly using Nimbus

```
make medalla-deposit VALIDATORS=2 # default is just 1
```


## Key management

Keys are stored in the `build/data/[testnet_name]/` folder, under `secrets` and `validators` - make sure you keep these folders backed up.

The `secrets` folder contains the common secret that gives you access to all your validator keys.

The `validators` folder contains your keystores. Keystores are used by validators as a method for exchanging keys. 

For more on keys in eth2, see [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/05/21/keys/).




## Metrics

Metrics are not included in the binary by default - to enable them, use the following options when starting the client:

```
make NIMFLAGS="-d:insecure" medalla
```

You can then browse the metrics by connecting to:

http://localhost:8008/metrics

Make sure this port is protected as the http server used is not considered secure (it should not be used by untrusted peers).

## Troubleshooting


The first thing to say, is that you should make sure to restart and update your node regularly. Everytime you want to update your node to the latest version, run `git pull`, `make update`, followed by `make medalla`:

```
cd nim-beacon-chain
git pull
make update # Update dependencies
make medalla # Restart using same keys as last run
```

If you find that `make update` causes the console to hang for too long, try running `make update V=1` or `make update V=2` instead (these will print a more verbose output to the console which may make it easier to diagnose the problem).

>**Note:** rest assured that when you restart the beacon node, the software will resume from where it left off, using the validator keys you have already imported.


### Starting over

The directory that stores the blockchain data of the testnet is `build/data/shared_medalla_0` (if you're connecting to another testnet, replace `medalla` with that testnet's name). Delete this folder to start over (for example, if you started building medalla with the wrong private keys).

### Syncing
If youâ€™re experiencing sync problems, or have been running an old version of medalla, we recommend running `make clean-medalla` to restart your sync (make sure youâ€™ve updated to the latest `devel` branch first though).

### Keeping up with the head of the chain

As it stands, logging seems to be slowing down the client,  and quite a few users are experiencing trouble either catching up or keeping up with the head of the chain. You can use the `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` option to reduce verbosity and speed up the client.

```
make LOG_LEVEL=INFO medalla
```

### Low peer counts

If you're experiencing a low peer count, you may be behind a firewall. Try restarting your client and passing `NODE_PARAMS="--nat:\"extip:$EXT_IP_ADDRESS\"` as an option to `make medalla`, where `$EXT_IP_ADDRESS` is your real IP. For example, if your real IP address is `35.124.65.104`, you'd run:

```
make NODE_PARAMS="--nat:\"extip:35.124.65.104\" medalla
```

### Resource leaks

If you're experiencing RAM related resource leaks, try restarting your client (we recommend restarting every 6 hours until we've fixed [this issue](https://github.com/status-im/nim-beacon-chain/issues/1518)). If you have a [local Grafana setup](https://github.com/status-im/nim-beacon-chain#getting-metrics-from-a-local-testnet-client), you can try monitoring the severity of these leaks and playing around with the restart interval.
